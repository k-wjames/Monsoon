# Monsoon

Monsoon is an android app done using Kotlin, employing modern app design and development and good practices.

The app will make good use of the following:

1. Coroutines
2. Flow
3. Jetpack Libraries
4. Dependency Injection
5. Git version Control
6. Material Design

# The Goal
This project is aimed at building solid app that meets modern standards and design practices in mobile development.

# Data
The app will consume data from a free api data source that will be persisted locally using Room Database. All CRUD operations will be implemented.

Should it be deemed necessary, I might create Spring Boot Restful Webservice and have it hosted on AWS to spice things up a little bit and beat the constraints of using free API data sources.

# Testing

To make sure the app will hold tight, the following test will be conducted:

1. Functional testing: does my app do what it's supposed to?
2. Performance testing: does it do it quickly and efficiently?
3. Accessibility testing: does it work well with accessibility services?
4. Compatibility testing: does it work well on every device and API level?

# Why Monsoon?
This project is my perfect playground. I'll build it, mess it, and rebuild it as I wish. There are no intentions of ever publishing this project on playstore. It's being used purely for practice to sharpen my understanding of the evolving mobile development.

# Collaborations?
While this is my own creation, I'd be very happy to collaborate with any other person interested in this wild adventure. The scope is not cast in stone, we can always adjust to spice things up.

# Can I clone the repo?

Do so at your convinience. Stretch the project to the extremes and be kind enough to share your exploits and wild adventure.
