# Monsoon

Monsoon is an android app built using Kotlin. It employs good android development practices and modern app design/development.

The app will make good use of the following:

1. Coroutines
2. Flow
3. Jetpack Libraries
4. Dependency Injection
5. Git version Control
6. Material Design

# The Goal
This project is aimed at building solid app that meets modern standards and design practices in mobile development.

# Data
The app will consume data from a free API data source that will be persisted locally using Room Database. All CRUD operations will be implemented.

Should it be deemed necessary, I might create a Spring Boot Restful Web service and have it hosted on AWS to spice things up a little bit and beat the constraints of using free API data sources.

# Testing

To make sure the app will hold tight, the following tests will be conducted:

1. Functional testing: Will answer- does my app do what it's supposed to?
2. Performance testing:Will answer- does it do it quickly and efficiently?
3. Accessibility testing:Will answer- does it work well with accessibility services?
4. Compatibility testing:Will answer- does it work well on every device and API level?

# Why Monsoon?
This project is my perfect playground. I'll build it, mess it, and rebuild it as I wish. There are no intentions of ever publishing this project on playstore. It's being used purely for practice and to sharpen my understanding of the evolving mobile development.

# Collaborations?
While this is my own creation, I'd be very happy to collaborate with any other person interested in this wild adventure. The scope is not stone-cast, we can always adjust to spice things up.

# Can I clone the repo?

Do so at your convinience. Stretch the project to the extremes and be kind enough to share your exploits and wild adventure.
